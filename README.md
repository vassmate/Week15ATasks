# Week15ATasks
Repository for the Week 15A tasks.

# Initial description
- Regular expression:

(The Week15ATasks folder contains the InputValidator project.)

Using Visual Studio, create a new windows application project, and create a basic form,
which prompts the user his/her name, e-mail address and phone number.
After clicking the save button, evaluate the input if the phone number and e-mail address are valid. 
Since this is not a WinForms-oriented course you can perform this validation simply in the event handler of the save button.

- Serialization:

In this exercise, you modify a custom class so that developers can easily store it to the disk for later retrieval or transfer it across a network to another .NET Framework application. Open the C# project in the Lesson1-Serialize-People folder, and examine the contents! You need to modify the Person class to make it serializable.
