Repository for the Week 15A tasks.

# Initial description
- Regular expression:

(InputValidatorProject, UTF7ConverterProject)

Using Visual Studio, create a new windows application project, and create a basic form,
which prompts the user his/her name, e-mail address and phone number.
After clicking the save button, evaluate the input if the phone number and e-mail address are valid. 
Since this is not a WinForms-oriented course you can perform this validation simply in the event handler of the save button.

- Serialization:
 
(Not yet done.)

In this exercise, you modify a custom class so that developers can easily store it to the disk for later retrieval or transfer it across a network to another .NET Framework application. Open the C# project in the Lesson1-Serialize-People folder, and examine the contents! You need to modify the Person class to make it serializable.

- Threading:

(SimpleThreadingDemo, ThreadPoolDemo, SingleInstance)

In this exercise, you create a simple console application and start two threads simultaneously.
Create a simple console application in which you will use a Mutex to ensure there is only one instance of the application running at any point. If you encounter a problem completing an exercise, the completed projects are available on the companion CD in the Code folder.
Create an application that uses the thread pool to queue up methods to call on separate threads. If you encounter a problem completing an exercise, the completed projects are available on the companion CD in the Code folder.
